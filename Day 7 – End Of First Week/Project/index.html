      <h2>Main Brain Parts</h2>
      <div class="POB">
        <div>
          <h3>1: Cerebrum</h3>
          <p>
            The largest part of the brain, responsible for voluntary activities,
            sensory perception, and cognitive functions.
          </p>
          <p>It controls:</p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>Thinking</li>
            <li>Memory</li>
            <li>Emotions</li>
            <li>Speech</li>
            <li>Movement</li>
            <li>Decision Making</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is responsible for intelligence and conscious actions. The outer
            layer of the cerebrum is called the <em>cerebral cortex</em>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>2: Cerebellum</h3>
          <p>
            The cerebellum is located at the back of the brain, under the
            cerebrum.It is responsible for motor control, coordination, and
            balance.
          </p>
          <p>It controls:</p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>Balance</li>
            <li>Coordination</li>
            <li>Posture</li>
            <li>Fine motor skills (like writing or typing)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It helps make movements smooth and precise.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>3: Brainstem</h3>
          <p>
            The brainstem connects the brain to the spinal cord. It is
            responsible for basic life functions like breathing, heart rate, and
            sleep.
          </p>
          <p>It controls:</p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>Breathing</li>
            <li>Heart rate</li>
            <li>Sleep</li>
            <li>Wakefulness</li>
            <li>Balance</li>
            <li>Coordination</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It keeps you alive by managing vital body functions without you
            thinking about them.

        <div>
          <h3>1: Sensory Memory</h3>
          <p>
            Sensory memory is the brain’s very short-term storage that lasts
            only a few seconds.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It holds information from your senses (sight, sound, touch, smell,
              taste) just long enough for the brain to decide if it’s important.
            </li>
            <li>
              Example: Seeing a flash of light and remembering it for a brief
              moment.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>2: Short-Term Memory</h3>
          <p>
            Short-term memory temporarily stores information you are currently
            thinking about or using.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Usually lasts about 20–30 seconds without repetition.</li>
            <li>
              Can hold 5–9 items at once (like a phone number you just heard).
            </li>
            <li>
              Example: Remembering a new name right after someone tells you.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>3: Long-Term Memory</h3>
          <p>
            Long-term memory is where information is stored for hours, days, or
            even a lifetime.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Includes facts, experiences, skills, and knowledge.</li>
            <li>
              Can be explicit (conscious) or implicit (unconscious skills).
            </li>
            <li>
              Example: Remembering how to ride a bike or your first day at
              school.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
      <div>
        <ul class="facts-list">
          <li>The human brain weighs about 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds).</li>
          <li>It contains around 86 billion neurons.</li>
          <li>
            The brain consumes roughly 20% of the body’s energy even though it’s
            only 2% of body weight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brain cells, called neurons, can send signals up to 120 meters per
            second.
          </li>
          <li>The brain is more active at night than during the day.</li>
          <li>
            Memory storage is not in one spot; different areas store different
            types of memories.
          </li>
          <li>Your brain generates about 50,000 thoughts per day.</li>
          <li>
            The human brain has more connections than there are stars in the
            Milky Way.
          </li>
          <li>It can process an image in as little as 13 milliseconds.</li>
          <li>
            Laughing, exercise, and learning all increase brain activity and
            create new neural connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            The brain can reorganize itself after injury — this is called
            neuroplasticity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sleep is essential: lack of sleep can negatively affect memory,
            learning, and mood.
          </li>
          <li>
            The brain contains 75% water, which helps it function properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Emotions are processed in the amygdala, while logical thinking
            happens in the prefrontal cortex.
          </li>
          <li>
            The brain can store limitless amounts of information, unlike a
            computer.

## DAY 4 - JavaScript Core 1

## WHAT I COVERED TOADAY

* Basics
* Variables
* Booleans
* If-Statements
* Functions
* Objects
* DOM (Document Object Model)

## Opinion of Day 4:
It's getting more interesting with getting deeper but it's also getting harder too.
Learning Javascript in such little time is quite feeling like doing something very great.
I worked more than 6-8 hours today...and now it's time to get some rest..
Bye.
